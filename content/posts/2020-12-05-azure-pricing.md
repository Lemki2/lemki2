In order to use Azure, we need an Azure subscription.

Azure Subscriptions are linked to accounts that created the subscription.

There are 3 main types of subscriptions:
* Free
Unlimited access with Â£200 credit as as trial.
* Pay as you go
Pay for the services and resources that we use on a monthly basis.
* Member Benefits
Like MDN subscribers. Substantial discounts over pay as you go subscription.

The person who creates the Azure subscription becomes the global administrator for that subscription.

Separate subscriptions can be a way to create a division of responsibility for Azure services.

There are 3 purchasing options.
* Enterprise

Customer enters into an enterprise agreement.
